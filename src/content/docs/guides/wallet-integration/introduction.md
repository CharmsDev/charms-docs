This guide provides wallet providers with the technical specifications needed to integrate Charms support into their applications.

By implementing this protocol, wallet providers can offer their users the ability to view, transfer, and interact with Charmsâ€”enabling new use cases such as collectibles, tokens, and programmable assets on Bitcoin without requiring additional blockchains or layer-2 solutions.

## Benefits of Integration

By implementing this protocol, wallet providers can offer their users the ability to:

- View and manage Charms assets
- Transfer Charms (both NFTs and fungible tokens)
- Interact with Charms-enabled applications
- Participate in the growing Charms ecosystem

## Integration Steps

A complete Charms wallet integration consists of several components:

1. **Visualization**: Displaying Charms assets in the wallet interface
2. **Transfer NFTs**: Enabling users to send and receive Charms
3. **Transfer Tokens**: Connecting to the Charms API for transaction creation
4. **Wallet features considerations**: Some current operations like UTXO consolidation need to be Charms-compliant
